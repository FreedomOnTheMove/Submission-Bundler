<h1>Freedom on the Move<br/>Slave Advertisement Contributor Guide</h1>

<p>
    <strong>Our core mission is to rediscover the stories of self-liberating people.</strong><br/>
    By reading this guide, you will be ready to contribute new advertisements to the project.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Organization on your part is paramount from this point on.</strong><br/>
    <strong>All metadata</strong>​ you collect about the advertisements <strong>will be regarded as truth</strong><br>
    This information will serve as the basis for all future crowdsourcing contributions.
</p>

<h2>Section One: Collection &amp; Collation</h2>
<p>
    After you have identified sources of advertisements, you are ready to begin collecting.<br/>
    We recommend following this process as it prevents you from performing double work.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>For each newspaper you've identified please:</strong>
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Record then ewspaper name, publication city and publication state.</li>
    <li>Create a new folder (the newspaper name tends to be a safe choice).</li>
    <li>Inside this folder create an empty spreadsheet named advertisement-manifest.csv.</li>
</ol>


<p>
    <strong>For each advertisement you've identified:</strong>
</p>
<ol start="4">
    <li>Scan each advertisement at 300 DPI. Crop out extraneous content that surrounds the advertisement.</li>
    <li>Save the scan with a unique filename in the folder corresponding to the newspaper it appeared in.</li>
    <li>In that folder's advertisement-manifest.csv file do the following:
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Create a new row</li>
            <li>In column one, put the filename used in step two.</li>
            <li>In column two, put the advertisement’s publication date in yyyy-mm-dd format.</li>
            <li>In column three, put the page number the ad appeared on.<br/><strong>Leave this column blank if this is not known.</strong></li>
            <li>In column four, put the full text transcription of the advertisement.<br/><strong>Leave this column blank if no transcription is available.</strong></li>
        </ol>

    </li>
</ol>
